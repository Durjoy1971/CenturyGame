This is a 1 vs 1 Game. The Player who will reach 100 first will win the game. By Rolling Dice, you can score runs except the number 1. The number 1 means you are out and you will not get any scores. So, if you don't want to roll dice, you can HOLD to add gained score to total score and give your opposition a chance.
